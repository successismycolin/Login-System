# Login-System

This is a login system program that prompts a user to either create an account or log in to an already existing account. This is a simple program that incorporates concepts that include flow control (loops and if statements), file handling, error handling, functional programming and test-driven development (TDD).

This program can be ran from a terminal. Here are instructions on how to run the program.
    - After running the program you will be asked whether you intend to create a new account or log in to an existing one,
    - After choosing one of the two options, you will be prompted to input a username and a password, and these details will be validated based on the action to chose at the beginning of the program.
    - You will then get a message informing of whether your entry was successful or not. If successful, the program terminates, and if not, you have the ability to try again.
